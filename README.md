# docthosegrades
For teachers and tutors, including our client, grading tens upon hundreds of team projects, “Doc Those Grades” is a project marking tool 
that provides visual representations of the work contributions of team members working on Google Docs. Unlike the Git system, GitInspector, 
our product is web-based, user-friendly, and can be accessed anytime from anywhere.
