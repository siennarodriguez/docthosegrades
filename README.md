# docthosegrades
For teachers and tutors, including our client, grading tens upon hundreds of team projects, “Doc Those Grades” is a project marking tool 
that provides visual representations of the work contributions of team members working on Google Docs. Unlike the Git system, GitInspector, 
our product is web-based, user-friendly, and can be accessed anytime from anywhere.

Languages this project will be using are Javascript, CSS and HTML.

The APIs to be used include:
google drive REST	to implement the underlying functionality of the product,
google timeline		for the timeline feature,
google pie chart	for the pie chart feature,
